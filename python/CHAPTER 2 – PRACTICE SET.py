#  1. Write a python program to add two numbers.

X = int(input("Enter 1st number: "))
Y = int(input("Enter 2nd number: "))
print(X + Y)


# 2 Write a python program to find remainder when a number is divided by z.
number = int(input("Enter a Number"))
Z = int(input("Enter divisor by z"))
remainder = number % Z
print("the remainder",remainder)

#3. Check the type of variable assigned using input () function.
value = input("Enter some variable : ")
print("You entered:", value)
print("Type of variable is:", type(value))


#4.Use comparison operator to find out whether ‘a’ given variable a is greater than ‘b’ or not. Take a = 34 and b = 80 
a = 34
b = 80 

X = a > b
print("comparison operator", X)

#5.. Write a python program to find an average of two numbers entered by the user

x = int(input("enter any number"))
y = int(input("Enter any number"))
average = x + y /2 
print("your average will be", average)

#6. 6. Write a python program to calculate the square of a number entered by the user.
n = int(input("enter the number"))
num = n * n
print( "The Square = " ,num )
