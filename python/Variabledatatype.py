print(b)

#data type
# "we need a data type becsuse we hold a different type of variable"
a1 = 6
b = "Harry"
c = True
d = None
e = complex(8, 2) # 6+3i
f = 6 + 5j
print(b)
print(a + a1)
print (" The type of a is", type(a1))
print("The type of b is", type(b))
print("the type of c is",type (c))
print("the type of e is",type (e))
